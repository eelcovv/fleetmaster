# Contributing to `fleetmaster`

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at <https://github.com/eelcovv/fleetmaster/issues>

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.

- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs.
Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement a fix for it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features.
Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

fleetmaster could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/eelcovv/fleetmaster/issues>.

If you are proposing a new feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `fleetmaster` for local development.
Please note this documentation assumes you already have `uv` and `Git` installed and ready to go.

1. Fork the `fleetmaster` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   cd <directory_in_which_repo_should_be_created>
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/fleetmaster.git
   ```

3. Now we need to install the environment. Navigate into the directory

   ```bash
   cd fleetmaster
   ```

   Then, install and activate the environment with:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Install pre-commit to run linters/formatters at commit time:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

5. Create a branch for local development:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Don't forget to add test cases for your added functionality to the `tests` directory.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the formatting tests.

   ```bash
   just check
   ```

8. Now, validate that all unit tests are passing:

   ```bash
   just test
   ```

9. Before raising a pull request you should also run tox.
   This will run the tests across different versions of Python:

   ```bash
   tox
   ```

   This requires you to have multiple versions of python installed.
   This step is also triggered in the CI/CD pipeline, so you could also choose to skip this step locally.

10. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

11. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Done!

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
   Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in `README.md`.

### Squashing Commits

To create a clean pull request with a single commit, you can squash your commits before pushing. Here is an example of how to do this from the command line:

**Step 1: Start the Interactive Rebase**

First, you need to determine the point from which you want to merge the commits. Usually, this is the point where your branch diverged from `main`.

1.  Ensure your `main` branch is up-to-date:

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

2.  Return to your feature branch (replace `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch):

    ```bash
    git checkout your-branch-name
    ```

3.  Start the interactive rebase. This will open an editor with a list of your commits:
    ```bash
    git rebase -i main
    ```

**Step 2: Squash the Commits**

In the editor that opens, you will see a list of your commits, each prefixed with the word `pick`.

1.  Keep the top (oldest) commit as `pick`.
2.  Change `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for all other commits you want to merge.
3.  Save the file and close the editor.

```
# Example of the rebase editor:
pick f7fde4a Fix feature A
squash 310154e Add tests for feature A
squash a5f4a0d Refactor feature A

# After your changes:
pick f7fde4a Fix feature A
s 310154e Add tests for feature A
s a5f4a0d Refactor feature A
```

**Step 3: Write the New Commit Message**

After closing the first editor, a new editor will open where you can write the commit message for the new, combined commit. The messages from the old commits are there for inspiration.

1.  Delete the old messages and write one clear, new commit message that summarizes all your work.
2.  Save the file and close the editor to complete the rebase.

**Step 4: Push Your Branch**

Because you have rewritten the history of your branch, you must use a "force push".

**Note:** This is a powerful action. Make sure you are the only one working on this branch.

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

(`--force-with-lease` is a safer alternative to `--force`.)

**Step 5: Create the Pull Request**

Now that your branch is updated on the remote (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), you can create the PR.

## Developers tips and tricks

### vscode

In case you want to add a quick launcher under `.vscode/launcher.json`, an example is:

```json
    "configurations": [
              {
            "name": "fleetmaster draf 1m",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "fleetmaster.cli",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "args": ["-v", "run", "examples/defraction_box_1m.stl"],
            "justMyCode": true
        },
    ]
```

### direnv

If you are only using a Python virtual environment (without Nix), you can use `direnv` to activate it automatically.
Create a `.envrc` file with the following content:

```shell
# Load the Python virtual environment if it exists
if [ -d .venv ]; then
  layout python .venv
fi
```

### linux

To install in linux

### nixos

To run the this packagine in a nix os environment, use the flake below to activate your environment.:

```nix
{
  description = "Development environment for the fleetmaster project";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
      in
      {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          packages = with pkgs; [
            # Python en package manager
            python312
            uv

            # Core dependencies voor de GUI
            vtk
            qt6.full

            # Essentiële libraries voor rendering en windowing
            mesa
            libglvnd
            wayland
            libxkbcommon
            xorg.libX11
            xorg.libXcursor
            xorg.libXrandr
            xorg.libXi
            fontconfig
            freetype
            harfbuzz
          ];
        };
      });
}
```

Activate the flake with

```
use flake flake.nix
```
