# Solution Database with Capytaine solutions

## Introduction

The database that is generated by fleetmaster contains one or more capytaine solutions, together with the mesh that was used for the solution calculation.
The general idea is that you make one version of your mesh. Normally this would be the vessel hull, but in our example we have just a small box called Base Mesh.
Typically you base mesh is located with the keel at the water level (which is z=0 by default) and the stern at $x=0$.

## Description of the database

The `Base mesh` is used as a reference. There are several `Candidate meshes` relative to the base mesh, each with its own defined center of gravity (cog). This cog can be independent of the actual geometric center of gravity; it is the cog used by Capytaine. By default, it is the center of the geometry at the water surface, so (0,0,0).
