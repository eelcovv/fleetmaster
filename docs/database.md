The `Base mesh` is used as a reference. There are several `Candidate meshes` relative to the base mesh, each with its own defined center of gravity (cog). This cog can be independent of the actual geometric center of gravity; it is the cog used by Capytaine. By default, it is the center of the geometry at the water surface, so (0,0,0).
